# I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Annihilate? No. No violence. __I won't stand for it.__ *Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!* I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

## I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

1. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
2. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
3. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

* No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
* It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. You've swallowed a planet! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
